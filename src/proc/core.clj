;;This is a quick example in clojure of how we can convert marathon 
;;location information into generalized location trends, and then 
;;extract location information over time.  Note, we also derive
;;information from marathon demand records, to cross walk the fill 
;;over time.  We may also incorporate deployment information 
;;from marathon to determine dwell before deployment.
;;Ideally.....
;;We have built a database of unit statistics that can 
;;support multiple queries....

;;The queries we want to support are:

;;Location fill over time (including unfilled).
  ;;Supports the generation of trends over time that depict a
  ;;container (location's) fill trend over time.
  ;;Note, we need to annotate the fact that the unit was
  ;;overlapping....
  ;;It may be helpful to annotate the state of the unit at each
  ;;location....
  ;;Particularly if we are broadcasting in clojure data structures...
  ;;Locations would be incredibly helpful if we add the unit's 
  ;;current state, and dwell time....
  ;;That adds to size of the data, however....
  ;;Since unit movement dictates location changes though, it leaves
  ;;the total size still fairly small....much more amenable to
  ;;querying after the fact.
  ;;One important fact is that we have meta-data associated with
  ;;locations.


;;Even better...we can cross-walk a unit's deployment information with 
;;it's location.  We currently know the unit's dwell before deploy 
;;due to location.  We can also filter out followon deployments....

;;If the unit's dwell-before deploy is useful
