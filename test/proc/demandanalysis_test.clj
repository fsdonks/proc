;;why not matching?
;;demands and periodrecords are the same
;;peak should be 4 for SRC "05315K000"
;;duplicate demand records.  arrrrgh!
;;taa20-24 vignette consolidated included the same SRC in two records with a quantity
;;of one.  How should we interpret this?
;;now, duplicates are counted in vba tadmudi but not in sparkcharts. Don't take action until
;;next year. when ask FM how duplicates should be interpreted (warn about duplicates in sparks
;;but no need in vba tadmudi since we can check the demand before loaded into tadmudi).
;;looks like we only kept one of the duplicate records for 21-25, so duplicate diff between
;;tadmudi and sparkcharts probably didn't occur.
;;For this test case on NIPR,
;;1) warn about dupes, but run the code. done with duplicate-demands
;;2) make all duplicates non dupes-done by unique priority for each record.
;;what is a demand name?  Priority_vignette_SRC_[startday...endday]

;;Update 01/18/2019: For sparkcharts and activity profiles, what
;;really matters is that no two records are identical or one of the
;;records will be skipped.  I fixed this with a unique DemandIndex for
;;all records.
